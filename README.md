# AITaboo

AI-themed version of Taboo, released initially as a paper version at the [PL in ML: Polish View on Machine Learning 2018](https://conference2018.mlinpl.org).
The cards have been handcrafted by the member of [ML in PL Association](https://mlinpl.org) or generated by AI based on Wikipedia articles about AI and ML.
This online version was coded for [ML in PL: Virtual Event 2020](https://virtual-event.mlinpl.org).

We will gladly accept "pull requests" with new cards :)
